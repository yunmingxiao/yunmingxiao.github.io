This newfound fame is matched by increasing notoriety — for their potential to serve as hubs for illegal content — and a presumably ever-increasing network footprint. It is fair to say that a complex ecosystem has developed around Kodi, composed of millions of users, thousands of “add-ons” – Kodi extensions from from 3rd-party developers – and content providers. Motivated by these observations, this paper aims at conducing the first analysis of the Kodi ecosystem. Our rationale is to build some “crawling” software around Kodi which can automatically install an addon, explore its menu, and locate (video) content. This is challenging for many reasons. First, Kodi largely relies on visual information and user input which intrinsically complicates automation. Second, no central aggregators for Kodi addons exist. Third, the potential sheer size of this ecosystem requires a highly scalable crawling solution. We address these challenges with de-Kodi, a full fledged crawling system capable of discovering and crawling large cross-sections of Kodi’s decentralized ecosystem at tunable levels of depth and breadth. With de-Kodi, we discovered and tested over 9,000 distinct Kodi addons. Our results demonstrate de-Kodi, which we make available to the general public, to be a essential asset in studying one of the largest multimedia platforms in the world. Our work further serves as the first ever transparent and repeatable analysis of the Kodi ecosystem at large.","tags":null,"title":"De-Kodi: Understanding the Kodi Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Free and open source media centers are currently experiencing a boom in popularity.

Typically, the clustering mutants on networks can dramatically alter the direction of selection. Previous studies on the assortment of mutants assume that individuals interact in a frequency-dependent way. It is hard to tell how assortment alone alters the evolutionary fate. We establish a minimal network model to disentangle the assortment from the game interaction. We find that for weak selection limit, the assortment of mutants plays little role in fixation probability. For strong selection limit, connected mutants, i.e., the maximum assortment, are best for fixation. When the mutants are separated by only one wild-type individual, it is worse off than that separated by more than one wild-type individual in fixation probability. Our results show the nontrivial yet fundamental effect of the clustering on fixation. Noteworthily, it has already arisen, even if the game interaction is absent.","tags":["Evolutionary Game Theory","Population Dynamics"],"title":"Close spatial arrangement of mutants favors and disfavors fixation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aritra Dutta","El Houcine Bourger","Yunming Xiao","Marco Canini","Peter Richtarik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559034753,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559034753,"objectID":"eebe9374e6d98e2ae6d85a7b235d7d1a","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/dna/","publishdate":"2019-05-28T09:12:33Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dna/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimization acceleration techniques such as momentum play a key role in state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Recently, generic vector sequence extrapolation techniques, such as regularized nonlinear acceleration (RNA) of Scieur et al., were proposed and shown to accelerate fixed point iterations. In contrast to RNA which computes extrapolation coefficients by (approximately) setting the gradient of the objective function to zero at the extrapolated point, we propose a more direct approach, which we call direct nonlinear acceleration (DNA). In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational cost of DNA is comparable to that of RNA, our direct approach significantly outperforms RNA on both synthetic and real-world datasets. While the focus of this paper is on convex problems, we obtain very encouraging results in accelerating the training of neural networks.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Direct Nonlinear Acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haifeng Sun","Yunming Xiao","Jing Wang","Jingyu Wang","Qi Qi","Jianxin Liao","Xiulei Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"3ae0d84b0d85903e3ecc5faa2eed2e23","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/ieee19/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ieee19/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks have been used for traffic classifications and promising results have been obtained. However, most of the previous work confined to one specific task of the classification, where restricts the classifier potential performance and application areas. The traffic flow can be labeled from a different perspective which might help to improve the accuracy of classifier by exploring more meaningful latent features. In addition, deep neural network (DNN)-based model is hard to adapt the changes in new classification demand, because of training such a new model costing not only many computing resources but also lots of labeled data. For this purpose, we proposed a multi-output DNN model simultaneously learning multi-task traffic classifications. In this model, the common knowledge of traffic is exploited by the synergy among the tasks and improves the performance of each task separately. Also, it is showed that this structure shares the potential of meeting new demands in the future and meanwhile being able to achieve the classification with advanced speed and fair accuracy. One-shot learning, which refers to the learning process with scarce data, is also explored and our approach shows notable performance.","tags":["Traffic Classification","Multi-Task model","Transfer Learning","One-Shot Learning"],"title":"Common Knowledge Based and One-Shot Learning Enabled Multi-Task Traffic Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Haifeng Sun","Zirui Zhuang","Jingyu Wang","Qi Qi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"9800cf13a8310c14b9b876fdb6a4756c","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/lcn18/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lcn18/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks have been used for traffic classification, and promising results are obtained.
