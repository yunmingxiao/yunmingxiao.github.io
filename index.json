We revisit POSIX-compatible object storage for GPU-centric pipelines and present ROS2, an RDMA-first design that offloads the DAOS client to an NVIDIA BlueField-3 SmartNIC while leaving the server-side DAOS I/O engine unchanged. ROS2 splits a lightweight gRPC control plane from a high-throughput data plane (UCX/libfabric over RDMA or TCP), removing host mediation from the data path. Using FIO/DFS across local and remote settings, we show that on server-grade CPUs RDMA consistently outperforms TCP for large sequential and small random I/O. When the client is offloaded to BlueField-3, RDMA performance matches the host; TCP on the SmartNIC lags, underscoring RDMA’s advantage for offloaded deployments. We conclude that an RDMA-first, SmartNIC-offloaded object store is a practical foundation for LLM data delivery; optional GPUDirect placement is left for future work.

Recent studies indicate that numerous applications can benefit from RDMA integration, and RDMA hardware resources are being shared among these diversifying applications. However, today’s RDMA frameworks mostly view their software and hardware stacks as two independent subsystems, making it difficult for developers to align the performance objectives of RDMA applications with the limited resources in RDMA hardware. We are developing a framework called SwiftRDMA, with the vision of enabling software-defined RDMA scheduling. SwiftRDMA views RDMA resource sharing as a scheduling problem. SwiftRDMA pinpoints the root causes of RDMA resource contentions and SLO violations, linking them to a set of trackable signals and controllable actions. A software scheduler then translates various operator demands into scheduling policies, which leverage the exposed signals and actions to achieve intended performance objectives.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a key component of Internet-based communication and its privacy has been neglected for years. Recently, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has improved the situation by fixing the issue of in-path middleboxes. Further progress has been made with proxy-based solutions such as Oblivious DoH (ODoH), which separate a user's identity from their DNS queries. However, these solutions rely on non-collusion assumptions between DNS resolvers and proxies -- an assumption difficult to guarantee in practice. To address this, we explore integrating single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR) into DNS to enable encrypted query processing without relying on trust assumptions. However, applying PIR to DNS is challenging due to its hierarchical nature -- particularly, interactions with recursive resolvers can still leak information. Navigating performance and privacy trade-offs, we propose PDNS, a DNS extension leveraging single-server PIR to strengthen privacy guarantees. We have implemented a prototype of PDNS and compared its performance against state-of-the-art solutions via trace-driven experiments. The results show that PDNS achieves acceptable performance (2x faster than DoH over Tor with similar privacy guarantees) and strong privacy guarantees today, mainly at the cost of its scalability, which specialized hardware for PIR can address in the near future.

In this paper, we present PreAcher, a system architecture that incorporates third-party Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) into the password authentication process and offloads the authentication workload to CDNs without divulging the passwords to them. At the core of PreAcher is a novel three-party authentication protocol that combines Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF) and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). This protocol allows CDNs to pre-authenticate users and thus filter out ADoS traffic without compromising password security. Our evaluations demonstrate that PreAcher significantly enhances the resilience of web servers against both ADoS attacks and preserves password security while introducing acceptable overheads.

Randomized distribution optimizes for the aggregate case, spreading load across flows over time. However, there exists a class of important Precise Traffic Control (PTC) tasks that are at odds with ECMP randomness. For instance, if an end host perceives that its flows are traversing a problematic switch/link, it often needs to change their paths before a fix can be rolled out. With randomized hashing, existing solutions resort to modifying flow tuples; since hashing mechanisms are unknown and they vary across switches/vendors, it may take many trials before yielding a new path. Many other similar cases exist where precise and timely response is critical to the network. We propose programmable ECMP (P-ECMP), a programming model, compiler, and runtime that provides precise traffic control. P-ECMP leverages an oft-ignored feature, ECMP groups, which allows for a constrained set of capabilities that are nonetheless sufficiently expressive for our tasks. An operator supplies high-level descriptions of their topology and policies, and our compiler generates PTC configurations for each switch. End hosts can reconfigure specific flows to use different PTC policies precisely and quickly, addressing a range of important use cases. We have evaluated P-ECMP using simulation at scale, and deployed one use case to a real-world data center that serves live user traffic.

Nonetheless, prior research has highlighted the inefficient utilization of computing resources in distributed ML, leading to suboptimal performance. This inefficiency primarily stems from CPU bottlenecks and suboptimal accelerator scheduling. Although numerous proposals have been put forward to address these issues individually, none have effectively tackled both inefficiencies simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Conspirator, an innovative control plane design aimed at alleviating both bottlenecks by harnessing the enhanced computing capabilities of SmartNICs. Following the evolving role of SmartNICs, which have transitioned from their initial function of standard networking task offloading to serving as programmable connectors between disaggregated computing resources, Conspirator facilitates efficient data transfer without the involvement of host CPUs and hence circumvents the potential bottlenecks there. Conspirator further integrates a novel scheduling algorithm that takes into consideration of the heterogeneity of accelerators and adapts to changing workload dynamics, enabling the flexibility to mitigate the second bottleneck. Our evaluation demonstrates that Conspirator may provide a 15% end-to-end completion time reduction compared to RDMA-based alternatives while being 17% more cost-effective and 44% more power-efficient. Our proposed scheduler also helps to save 33% GPU hours compared to naive GPU-sharing schedulers by making close-to-optimal decisions while taking much less time than the optimal NP-Hard scheduler.

However, these requirements are at odds with the resource allocation capabilities of conventional networking stacks in wide-area networks (WANs).

In this paper, we advocate for a radical new approach to extend TE systems to involve millions of virtual instance endpoints. We propose and implement a first-of-its-kind system, called MegaTE, to satisfy the needs of each fine-grained traffic flow at the virtual instance level. At the core of the MegaTE system is the paradigm shift from the top-down centralized control to the bottom-up asynchronous query in the TE control loop, combined with eBPF-based segment routing on the data plane and TE optimization contraction on the control plane. We evaluate MegaTE using flow-level simulations with production traffic traces. Our results show that MegaTE supports 20× more endpoints with the similar algorithm run time compared to prior work. MegaTE has been adopted by large-scale public cloud providers. Notably, Tencent rolled out MegaTE in its cloud WAN since December 2022.

Its failures threaten network stability and will usually result in large-scale packet losses. Thus, the non-stop routing (NSR) capability that protects inter-domain connectivity from being disrupted by various failures, is critical to any Autonomous System (AS) operator. Replicating the BGP and underlying TCP connection status is key to realizing NSR. But existing NSR solutions, which heavily rely on OS kernel modifications, have become impractical due to providers’ adoption of virtualized network gateways for better scalability and manageability.\nIn this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing TENSOR, which incorporates a novel kernel-modification-free replication design and lightweight architecture. More concretely, the kernel-modification-free replication design mitigates the reliance on OS kernel modification and hence allows the virtualization of the network gateway. Meanwhile, lightweight virtualization provides strong performance guarantees and improves system reliability. Moreover, TENSOR provides a solution to the split-brain problem that affects NSR solutions. Through extensive experiments, we show that TENSOR realizes NSR while bearing little overhead compared to open-source BGP implementations. Further, our two-year operational experience on a fleet of 400 servers controlling over 31,000 BGP peering connections demonstrates that TENSOR reduces the development, deployment, and maintenance costs significantly – at least by factors of 20, 5, and 10, respectively, while retaining the same SLA with the NSR-enabled routers.

Kodi is today’s most popular home media center, with millions of users worldwide. Kodi’s popularity derives from its ability to centralize the sheer amount of media content available on the Web, both free and copyrighted. Researchers have been hinting at potential security concerns around Kodi, due to add-ons injecting unwanted content as well as user settings linked with security holes. Motivated by these observations, this paper conducts the first comprehensive analysis of the Kodi ecosystem: 15,000 Kodi users from 104 countries, 11,000 unique add-ons, and data collected over 9 months. Our work makes three important contributions. Our first contribution is that we build “crawling” software (de-Kodi) which can automatically install a Kodi add-on, explore its menu, and locate (video) content. This is challenging for two main reasons. First, Kodi largely relies on visual information and user input which intrinsically complicates automation. Second, the potential sheer size of this ecosystem (i.e., number of available add-ons) requires a highly scalable crawling solution. Our second contribution is that we develop a solution to discover Kodi add-ons. Our solution combines Web crawling of popular websites where Kodi add-ons are published (LazyKodi and GitHub) and SafeKodi, a Kodi add-on we have developed which leverages the help of Kodi users to learn which add-ons are used in the wild and, in return, offers information about how safe these add-ons are, e.g., do they track user activity or contact sketchy URLs/IP addresses. Our third contribution is a classifier to passively detect Kodi traffic and add-on usage in the wild. Our analysis of the Kodi ecosystem reveals the following findings. We find that most installed add-ons are unofficial but safe to use. Still, 78% of the users have installed at least one unsafe add-on, and even worse, such add-ons are among the most popular. In response to the information offered by SafeKodi, one-third of the users reacted by disabling some of their add-ons. However, the majority of users ignored our warnings during several months attracted by the content such unsafe add-ons have to offer. Last but not least, we show that Kodi’s auto-update, a feature active for 97.6% of SafeKodi users, makes Kodi users easily identifiable by their ISPs. While passively identifying which Kodi add-on is in use is, as expected, much harder, we also find that many unofficial add-ons do not use HTTPS yet, making their passive detection straightforward.","tags":null,"title":"Decoding the Kodi Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Matteo Varvello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665914400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665914400,"objectID":"079381189e32051969afd63e142a6a4d","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/fiat/","publishdate":"2022-12-06T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fiat/","section":"publication","summary":"Home IoT (Internet of Things) deployments are vulnerable to local adversaries, compromising a LAN, and remote adversaries, compromising either the accounts associated with IoT devices or third-party devices like mobile phones used to control the IoT. There is, however, a fundamental difference between an attacker and a legitimate IoT user: the physical interaction with the device (e.g., via a mobile app) used to operate the IoT. Such physical interactions can be used to build frictionless authentications. However, their integration with IoT requires each vendor to independently adopt them, which is both complex and expensive. We instead design and build FIAT, the first third-party mechanism to automatically authorize IoT traffic by learning recurring traffic and validating human actions behind unpredictable traffic. FIAT does not require modification of the IoT devices or apps, as it operates passively on network traffic. Our evaluation shows that FIAT achieves high accuracy with minimal impact on the user experience.

However, requesters can only select a subset of devices with limited training data to execute federated learning (FL) tasks as a result of their limited budgets in today’s IoT scenario. To resolve this pressing issue, we devise a blockchain-enhanced FL market (BFL) to (i) make data in computationally bounded devices available for training with social Internet of things, (ii) maximize the amount of training data with given budgets for an FL task, and (iii) decentralize the FL market with blockchain. To achieve these goals, we firstly propose a trust-enhanced collaborative learning strategy (TCL) and a quality-oriented task allocation algorithm (QTA), where TCL enables training data sharing among trusted devices with social Internet of things, and QTA allocates suitable devices to execute FL tasks while maximizing the training quality with fixed budgets. Then, we devise an encrypted model training scheme (EMT) based on a simple but countervailable differential privacy methodology to prevent attacks from malicious devices. In addition, we also propose a contribution-driven delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to guarantee the fairness of reward distribution in the block generation process. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted to verify the proposed BFL could improve the total utility of requesters and average accuracy of FL models significantly.","tags":null,"title":"Blockchain-enhanced Federated Learning Market with Social Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aritra Dutta","El Houcine Bourger","Yunming Xiao","Marco Canini","Peter Richtarik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"eebe9374e6d98e2ae6d85a7b235d7d1a","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/dna/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dna/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimization acceleration techniques such as momentum play a key role in state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Recently, generic vector sequence extrapolation techniques, such as regularized nonlinear acceleration (RNA) of Scieur et al., were proposed and shown to accelerate fixed point iterations. In contrast to RNA which computes extrapolation coefficients by (approximately) setting the gradient of the objective function to zero at the extrapolated point, we propose a more direct approach, which we call direct nonlinear acceleration (DNA). In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational cost of DNA is comparable to that of RNA, our direct approach significantly outperforms RNA on both synthetic and real-world datasets. While the focus of this paper is on convex problems, we obtain very encouraging results in accelerating the training of neural networks.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Direct Nonlinear Acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Sarit Markovich","Aleksandar Kuzmanovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663545600,"objectID":"dd01e7dbc1ffbb18a413acce5f23e3c1","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/aft22/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aft22/","section":"publication","summary":"Having enabled numerous applications, blockchains have attracted not only much attention, in the past decade, but also huge amount of resources: talent, capital, energy, etc. Focusing on the mining side of the market, in this paper, we aim at understanding how to efficiently use the resources mining and staking pools attract. We start with developing predictions about factors that increase the efficient allocation of pools' resources. We then test our predictions based on a general model for optimal resource allocation that we develop, as well as data we collected on pools' actual resource allocations. We find that pools can increase resource efficiency by mining for more blockchains as well as by increasing the frequency of resource re-allocation. Further, we enroll to mining pools as a miner to understand and comment on how pools can encourage their miners to increase the efficiency of their allocation. While our empirical investigation mostly focuses on the BTC family, we show that our theory and results are general and applicable to the Ethereum family as well as other PoW and PoS chains.

Several studies have shown that users have way more bandwidth than they need, only using about 20-30% on a regular day. Several systems exploit this trend by enabling users to monetize their spare bandwidth, e.g., by sharing their WiFi connection or by participating in distributed proxy or VPN (dVPN) services. Despite the proliferation of such systems, little is known on how such marketplaces operate, what are the key factors that determine the price of the spare bandwidth, and how such prices differ worldwide. In this work, we shed some light on this topic using dVPNs as a use-case. We start by formalizing the problem of bandwidth monetization as an optimization between a buyer’s cost and seller’s income. Next, we explore three popular dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, and Tachyon) using both active and passive measurements. We find that dVPNs have a large and growing footprint, and offer comparable performance to their centralized counterpart. We identify Mysterium (in the US) as the most concrete realization of a bandwidth marketplace, for which we derive a value of spare Internet bandwidth ranging between 11 and 14 cents per GB. We also show that both buyers and sellers utilize ad-hoc “rules-of-thumb” when choosing their prices, which results in a sub-optimal marketplace. By applying our optimization, a seller’s income can be tripled by setting a price lower than the default one which allows to attract more buyers. These observations motivate us to create RING, a first and concrete system which helps sellers to automatically adjust their prices and traffic volumes across multiple marketplaces.","tags":null,"title":"Monetizing Spare Bandwidth: the Case of Distributed VPNs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marc Anthony Warrior","Yunming Xiao","Matteo Varvello","Aleksandar Kuzmanovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578614400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578614400,"objectID":"9847591e446cb7a1047c9f773e0f6d74","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/dekodi/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dekodi/","section":"publication","summary":"Free and open source media centers are currently experiencing a boom in popularity for the convenience and flexibility they offer users seeking to remotely consume digital content. This newfound fame is matched by increasing notoriety — for their potential to serve as hubs for illegal content — and a presumably ever-increasing network footprint. It is fair to say that a complex ecosystem has developed around Kodi, composed of millions of users, thousands of “add-ons” – Kodi extensions from from 3rd-party developers – and content providers. Motivated by these observations, this paper aims at conducing the first analysis of the Kodi ecosystem. Our rationale is to build some “crawling” software around Kodi which can automatically install an addon, explore its menu, and locate (video) content. This is challenging for many reasons. First, Kodi largely relies on visual information and user input which intrinsically complicates automation. Second, no central aggregators for Kodi addons exist. Third, the potential sheer size of this ecosystem requires a highly scalable crawling solution. We address these challenges with de-Kodi, a full fledged crawling system capable of discovering and crawling large cross-sections of Kodi’s decentralized ecosystem at tunable levels of depth and breadth. With de-Kodi, we discovered and tested over 9,000 distinct Kodi addons. Our results demonstrate de-Kodi, which we make available to the general public, to be a essential asset in studying one of the largest multimedia platforms in the world. Our work further serves as the first ever transparent and repeatable analysis of the Kodi ecosystem at large.","tags":null,"title":"De-Kodi: Understanding the Kodi Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Bin Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568592000,"objectID":"f9bdcd019fe4c8b8d57d3d3da4112dc5","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/ploscomp/","publishdate":"2019-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ploscomp/","section":"publication","summary":"Evolutionary dynamics on networks are key for biological and social evolution. Typically, the clustering mutants on networks can dramatically alter the direction of selection. Previous studies on the assortment of mutants assume that individuals interact in a frequency-dependent way. It is hard to tell how assortment alone alters the evolutionary fate. We establish a minimal network model to disentangle the assortment from the game interaction. We find that for weak selection limit, the assortment of mutants plays little role in fixation probability. For strong selection limit, connected mutants, i.e., the maximum assortment, are best for fixation. When the mutants are separated by only one wild-type individual, it is worse off than that separated by more than one wild-type individual in fixation probability. Our results show the nontrivial yet fundamental effect of the clustering on fixation. Noteworthily, it has already arisen, even if the game interaction is absent.","tags":["Evolutionary Game Theory","Population Dynamics"],"title":"Close spatial arrangement of mutants favors and disfavors fixation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Haifeng Sun","Zirui Zhuang","Jingyu Wang","Qi Qi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"9800cf13a8310c14b9b876fdb6a4756c","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/lcn18/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lcn18/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks have been used for traffic classification, and promising results are obtained. However, most previous work confined to one specific classification task and restricted the classifiers potential performance and applications. As the traffic flows can be labeled from different perspectives, the performance of the classifier might be improved by exploring more meaningful latent features. For this purpose, we adopted a multi-output DNN model that simultaneously learns different traffic classification tasks. The common knowledge of traffic is exploited by the synergy among the tasks and boosts the individual performances of the tasks. Experiments show that this structure has the potential to meet new future demands and achieve the classification with advanced speeds and fair accuracies. Yet, due to the heavy training cost, the neural networks, though achieving good performance, are hard to implement in the real environment. We further show that few-shot learning could be a viable approach.","tags":["Traffic Classification","Machine Learning"],"title":"Common Knowledge Based Transfer Learning for Traffic Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fd36605688ef45e10dc233c860158012","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/cv/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
