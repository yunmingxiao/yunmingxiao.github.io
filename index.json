Many research papers have demonstrated critical security concerns of the IoT, often due to lack of best practices like partial usage of HTTP, or old ciphers. Even when best security practices are implemented, the IoT is still vulnerable to many attacks. Intruders can penetrate the home WiFi and directly control some IoT devices. They can compromise the account associated with an IoT device, mostly relying on username and password, or of third-party services like IFTTT. They can also compromise the devices where IoT apps run,i.e., mostly mobile phones.\nThe above security concerns could be mitigated via two-factor authentication(2FA), as commonly done for online banking. With 2FA, the user is often required to validate her identity via, for instance, an SMS received on a mobile phone. Unfortunately, requiring a user to constantly validate her interactions with IoT devices is cumbersome, and unlikely to be accepted by users – which is why it is not used.\nThe goal of this work is to build a frictionlessIoT authentication mechanism. Our rationale is that IoT traffic is highly predictable, due to being mostly caused by software, e.g., to report at constant rate temperature readings from a smart thermostat, and less frequently triggered by routines set by the user, e.g., “turn on the heat each night at 6pm”, or by user via manual input, e.g., increase the thermostat temperature from its companion app. Predictable traffic can be learned and automatically authorized. Unpredictable traffic, when legitimate, is associated with some physical interaction between the user and a controlling device. We thus plan to automatically validate unpredictable traffic leveraging sensor data from the device used to control an IoT device, e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope on a mobile phone.\nOur first contribution is a quantification of the predictability of IoT traffic by analyzing public datasets. The analysis of public datasets shows that 80-90% of the IoT traffic (from hundred of devices) is indeed predictable. The second contribution of this work is the design of FIAT, a frictionless authentication mechanism for IoT traffic. FIAT is designed to improve the security of legacy IoT devices with minimal user input for authentication.\nResources RING: The first multi-vendors bandwidth marketplace -- \nPoster Yunming Xiao, Matteo Varvello (2021).

Recent studies suggest that the added cost for faster Internet speeds — e.g., $50 monthly to boost from 200 to 300 Mbps with Comcast Xfinity — is not worth to most residential users, which consume only 5% of their available bandwidth. Several systemswere launched which allow users to monetize such spare bandwidth, e.g., distributed proxy or VPN (Virtual Private Network) services.\nWhile such systems are attracting a considerable number of users, both as clients (buyers) and providers (sellers), little to nothing is known about such bandwidth marketplaces. We have identified distributed VPN (dVPNs) as the most concrete examples of such marketplaces because, in essence, a dVPN is a system which allows users to sell their spare bandwidth. The contribution of this work is an investigation of the dVPN ecosystem. We run active and passive measurements to characterize their footprint and performance.\nThe analysis of up to six months of dVPNs data shows that the three major dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, Tachyon ) compose together a fast-growing network footprint of thousands of nodes (sellers) located all over the world. These nodes offer download speeds comparable with ProtonVPN, a popular centralized VPN. Location-wise, the US is the most attractive market, with the majority of the traffic being destined to services located in the US.\n\nResources RING: The first multi-vendors bandwidth marketplace Poster Yunming Xiao, Matteo Varvello, Aleksandar Kuzmanovic (2021).

This newfound fame is matched by increasing notoriety — for their potential to serve as hubs for illegal content — and a presumably ever-increasing network footprint. It is fair to say that a complex ecosystem has developed around Kodi, composed of millions of users, thousands of “add-ons” – Kodi extensions from from 3rd-party developers – and content providers. Motivated by these observations, this paper aims at conducing the first analysis of the Kodi ecosystem. Our rationale is to build some “crawling” software around Kodi which can automatically install an addon, explore its menu, and locate (video) content. This is challenging for many reasons. First, Kodi largely relies on visual information and user input which intrinsically complicates automation. Second, no central aggregators for Kodi addons exist. Third, the potential sheer size of this ecosystem requires a highly scalable crawling solution. We address these challenges with de-Kodi, a full fledged crawling system capable of discovering and crawling large cross-sections of Kodi’s decentralized ecosystem at tunable levels of depth and breadth. With de-Kodi, we discovered and tested over 9,000 distinct Kodi addons. Our results demonstrate de-Kodi, which we make available to the general public, to be a essential asset in studying one of the largest multimedia platforms in the world. Our work further serves as the first ever transparent and repeatable analysis of the Kodi ecosystem at large.","tags":null,"title":"De-Kodi: Understanding the Kodi Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Free and open source media centers are currently experiencing a boom in popularity.

Typically, the clustering mutants on networks can dramatically alter the direction of selection. Previous studies on the assortment of mutants assume that individuals interact in a frequency-dependent way. It is hard to tell how assortment alone alters the evolutionary fate. We establish a minimal network model to disentangle the assortment from the game interaction. We find that for weak selection limit, the assortment of mutants plays little role in fixation probability. For strong selection limit, connected mutants, i.e., the maximum assortment, are best for fixation. When the mutants are separated by only one wild-type individual, it is worse off than that separated by more than one wild-type individual in fixation probability. Our results show the nontrivial yet fundamental effect of the clustering on fixation. Noteworthily, it has already arisen, even if the game interaction is absent.","tags":["Evolutionary Game Theory","Population Dynamics"],"title":"Close spatial arrangement of mutants favors and disfavors fixation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aritra Dutta","El Houcine Bourger","Yunming Xiao","Marco Canini","Peter Richtarik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559034753,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559034753,"objectID":"eebe9374e6d98e2ae6d85a7b235d7d1a","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/dna/","publishdate":"2019-05-28T09:12:33Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dna/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimization acceleration techniques such as momentum play a key role in state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Recently, generic vector sequence extrapolation techniques, such as regularized nonlinear acceleration (RNA) of Scieur et al., were proposed and shown to accelerate fixed point iterations. In contrast to RNA which computes extrapolation coefficients by (approximately) setting the gradient of the objective function to zero at the extrapolated point, we propose a more direct approach, which we call direct nonlinear acceleration (DNA). In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational cost of DNA is comparable to that of RNA, our direct approach significantly outperforms RNA on both synthetic and real-world datasets. While the focus of this paper is on convex problems, we obtain very encouraging results in accelerating the training of neural networks.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Direct Nonlinear Acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haifeng Sun","Yunming Xiao","Jing Wang","Jingyu Wang","Qi Qi","Jianxin Liao","Xiulei Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"3ae0d84b0d85903e3ecc5faa2eed2e23","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/ieee19/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ieee19/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks have been used for traffic classifications and promising results have been obtained.
