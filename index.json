Kodi is today’s most popular home media center, with millions of users worldwide. Kodi’s popularity derives from its ability to centralize the sheer amount of media content available on the Web, both free and copyrighted. Researchers have been hinting at potential security concerns around Kodi, due to add-ons injecting unwanted content as well as user settings linked with security holes. Motivated by these observations, this paper conducts the first comprehensive analysis of the Kodi ecosystem: 15,000 Kodi users from 104 countries, 11,000 unique add-ons, and data collected over 9 months. Our work makes three important contributions. Our first contribution is that we build “crawling” software (de-Kodi) which can automatically install a Kodi add-on, explore its menu, and locate (video) content. This is challenging for two main reasons. First, Kodi largely relies on visual information and user input which intrinsically complicates automation. Second, the potential sheer size of this ecosystem (i.e., number of available add-ons) requires a highly scalable crawling solution. Our second contribution is that we develop a solution to discover Kodi add-ons. Our solution combines Web crawling of popular websites where Kodi add-ons are published (LazyKodi and GitHub) and SafeKodi, a Kodi add-on we have developed which leverages the help of Kodi users to learn which add-ons are used in the wild and, in return, offers information about how safe these add-ons are, e.g., do they track user activity or contact sketchy URLs/IP addresses. Our third contribution is a classifier to passively detect Kodi traffic and add-on usage in the wild. Our analysis of the Kodi ecosystem reveals the following findings. We find that most installed add-ons are unofficial but safe to use. Still, 78% of the users have installed at least one unsafe add-on, and even worse, such add-ons are among the most popular. In response to the information offered by SafeKodi, one-third of the users reacted by disabling some of their add-ons. However, the majority of users ignored our warnings during several months attracted by the content such unsafe add-ons have to offer. Last but not least, we show that Kodi’s auto-update, a feature active for 97.6% of SafeKodi users, makes Kodi users easily identifiable by their ISPs. While passively identifying which Kodi add-on is in use is, as expected, much harder, we also find that many unofficial add-ons do not use HTTPS yet, making their passive detection straightforward.","tags":null,"title":"Decoding the Kodi Ecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengfei Wang","Yian Zhao","Mohammad S.

However, requesters can only select a subset of devices with limited training data to execute federated learning (FL) tasks as a result of their limited budgets in today’s IoT scenario. To resolve this pressing issue, we devise a blockchain-enhanced FL market (BFL) to (i) make data in computationally bounded devices available for training with social Internet of things, (ii) maximize the amount of training data with given budgets for an FL task, and (iii) decentralize the FL market with blockchain. To achieve these goals, we firstly propose a trust-enhanced collaborative learning strategy (TCL) and a quality-oriented task allocation algorithm (QTA), where TCL enables training data sharing among trusted devices with social Internet of things, and QTA allocates suitable devices to execute FL tasks while maximizing the training quality with fixed budgets. Then, we devise an encrypted model training scheme (EMT) based on a simple but countervailable differential privacy methodology to prevent attacks from malicious devices. In addition, we also propose a contribution-driven delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to guarantee the fairness of reward distribution in the block generation process. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted to verify the proposed BFL could improve the total utility of requesters and average accuracy of FL models significantly.","tags":null,"title":"Blockchain-enhanced Federated Learning Market with Social Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aritra Dutta","El Houcine Bourger","Yunming Xiao","Marco Canini","Peter Richtarik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"eebe9374e6d98e2ae6d85a7b235d7d1a","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/dna/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dna/","section":"publication","summary":"Optimization acceleration techniques such as momentum play a key role in state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Recently, generic vector sequence extrapolation techniques, such as regularized nonlinear acceleration (RNA) of Scieur et al., were proposed and shown to accelerate fixed point iterations. In contrast to RNA which computes extrapolation coefficients by (approximately) setting the gradient of the objective function to zero at the extrapolated point, we propose a more direct approach, which we call direct nonlinear acceleration (DNA). In DNA, we aim to minimize (an approximation of) the function value at the extrapolated point instead. We adopt a regularized approach with regularizers designed to prevent the model from entering a region in which the functional approximation is less precise. While the computational cost of DNA is comparable to that of RNA, our direct approach significantly outperforms RNA on both synthetic and real-world datasets. While the focus of this paper is on convex problems, we obtain very encouraging results in accelerating the training of neural networks.","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Direct Nonlinear Acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yunming Xiao","Sarit Markovich","Aleksandar Kuzmanovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663545600,"objectID":"dd01e7dbc1ffbb18a413acce5f23e3c1","permalink":"https://yunmingxiao.github.io/publication/aft22/","publishdate":"2022-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aft22/","section":"publication","summary":"Having enabled numerous applications, blockchains have attracted not only much attention, in the past decade, but also huge amount of resources: talent, capital, energy, etc. Focusing on the mining side of the market, in this paper, we aim at understanding how to efficiently use the resources mining and staking pools attract. We start with developing predictions about factors that increase the efficient allocation of pools' resources. We then test our predictions based on a general model for optimal resource allocation that we develop, as well as data we collected on pools' actual resource allocations. We find that pools can increase resource efficiency by mining for more blockchains as well as by increasing the frequency of resource re-allocation. Further, we enroll to mining pools as a miner to understand and comment on how pools can encourage their miners to increase the efficiency of their allocation. While our empirical investigation mostly focuses on the BTC family, we show that our theory and results are general and applicable to the Ethereum family as well as other PoW and PoS chains.

Several studies have shown that users have way more bandwidth than they need, only using about 20-30% on a regular day. Several systems exploit this trend by enabling users to monetize their spare bandwidth, e.g., by sharing their WiFi connection or by participating in distributed proxy or VPN (dVPN) services. Despite the proliferation of such systems, little is known on how such marketplaces operate, what are the key factors that determine the price of the spare bandwidth, and how such prices differ worldwide. In this work, we shed some light on this topic using dVPNs as a use-case. We start by formalizing the problem of bandwidth monetization as an optimization between a buyer’s cost and seller’s income. Next, we explore three popular dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, and Tachyon) using both active and passive measurements. We find that dVPNs have a large and growing footprint, and offer comparable performance to their centralized counterpart. We identify Mysterium (in the US) as the most concrete realization of a bandwidth marketplace, for which we derive a value of spare Internet bandwidth ranging between 11 and 14 cents per GB. We also show that both buyers and sellers utilize ad-hoc “rules-of-thumb” when choosing their prices, which results in a sub-optimal marketplace. By applying our optimization, a seller’s income can be tripled by setting a price lower than the default one which allows to attract more buyers. These observations motivate us to create RING, a first and concrete system which helps sellers to automatically adjust their prices and traffic volumes across multiple marketplaces.","tags":null,"title":"Monetizing Spare Bandwidth: the Case of Distributed VPNs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Home IoT (Internet of Things) deployments are vulnerable to local adversaries, compromising a LAN, and remote adversaries, compromising either the accounts associated with IoT devices or third-party devices like mobile phones used to control the IoT.

Recent studies suggest that the added cost for faster Internet speeds — e.g., $50 monthly to boost from 200 to 300 Mbps with Comcast Xfinity — is not worth to most residential users, which consume only 5% of their available bandwidth. Several systemswere launched which allow users to monetize such spare bandwidth, e.g., distributed proxy or VPN (Virtual Private Network) services.\nWhile such systems are attracting a considerable number of users, both as clients (buyers) and providers (sellers), little to nothing is known about such bandwidth marketplaces. We have identified distributed VPN (dVPNs) as the most concrete examples of such marketplaces because, in essence, a dVPN is a system which allows users to sell their spare bandwidth. The contribution of this work is an investigation of the dVPN ecosystem. We run active and passive measurements to characterize their footprint and performance.\nThe analysis of up to six months of dVPNs data shows that the three major dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, Tachyon ) compose together a fast-growing network footprint of thousands of nodes (sellers) located all over the world. These nodes offer download speeds comparable with ProtonVPN, a popular centralized VPN.

Typically, the clustering mutants on networks can dramatically alter the direction of selection. Previous studies on the assortment of mutants assume that individuals interact in a frequency-dependent way. It is hard to tell how assortment alone alters the evolutionary fate. We establish a minimal network model to disentangle the assortment from the game interaction. We find that for weak selection limit, the assortment of mutants plays little role in fixation probability. For strong selection limit, connected mutants, i.e., the maximum assortment, are best for fixation. When the mutants are separated by only one wild-type individual, it is worse off than that separated by more than one wild-type individual in fixation probability. Our results show the nontrivial yet fundamental effect of the clustering on fixation.

For this purpose, we adopted a multi-output DNN model that simultaneously learns different traffic classification tasks. The common knowledge of traffic is exploited by the synergy among the tasks and boosts the individual performances of the tasks. Experiments show that this structure has the potential to meet new future demands and achieve the classification with advanced speeds and fair accuracies. Yet, due to the heavy training cost, the neural networks, though achieving good performance, are hard to implement in the real environment.
